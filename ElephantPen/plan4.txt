1. Requirements Specification
        The computer simulates the elephant one, elephant two, and zookeeper's pen choice 100,000 times
        Displays what percentage of the time there is at least one elephant in the pen the zookeeper checks(Using 2% points as the margin of error)
        Also displays when there is an elephant in the pen, what percentage of the time both elephants are in the same pen(Using 2% points as the margin of error)
        Then display's if the zookeeper or custodian is correct.
        Prompt user to see if they want to run the simulation again
        Runs again or stops the program accordingly


2. System Analysis
        percent of one elephant = ((# of times there is one elephant/ 100000) * 100)
        percent of both elephants = ((# of times there are both elephants/ 100000) * 100)

3. System Design
        import random module
        Define two variables ("atLeastOne" and "both")
        Use a for loop to run through 100000 iterations
            checking:
                    Elephant one's pen selection
                    Elephant two's pen selection
                    Zookeeper's pen selection
        When the pen selections are the same, add to the variables count
            zookeeper == elephantOne
            zookeeper == elephantTwo
            zookeeper == elephantOne and zookeeper == elephantTwo
        Calculate percent of times that the zookeeper finds one elephant and display
        Calculate percent ot times that the zookeeper finds both elephants and display
        Determine if zookeeper or custodian was correct and display
        Prompt user to see if they would like to run the program again
