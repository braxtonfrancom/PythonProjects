1. Requirements Specification
        The computer will display all fluky numbers between 1 and 10,000
        The computer will display the total time
        The computer will display the total number of loops

2. System Analysis
        flukyNum = the sum of a set of random numbers(in range(1, num))
        seedValue = the factors of the number(not including itself)

3. System Design
    import random module
    import time module
    define variables
    Use a nested for loop for 10,000 iterations
        for i in range(1, num)
            if num % i == 0
                seed(i)
                total += randint(1, num)
                Use an if statement to "break" and limit number of iterations
    Use an if statement to "break" if the program finds 7 fluky numbers
    Each time a fluky number is found, display it
    Display the total time
    Display the total number of loops
