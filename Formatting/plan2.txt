    Get input for federal tax withheld
    Get input for state tax withheld
    Display <User name> PAY INFORMATION

    Lastly, display net pay


2. System Analysis

    gross pay = hours worked * pay rate
    Federal withholding = <Federal % withheld> * gross pay
    State withholding = <State % withheld> * gross pay
    Total deduction = Federal withholding + State withholding
    net pay = gross pay - total deduction

3. System Design

    Prompt user for employee name
    Prompt user for number of hours worked in a week
    Prompt user for hourly pay rate
    Prompt user for federal tax withholding rate
    Prompt user for state tax withholding rate
    Display <userName> PAY INFORMATION
    Calculate Gross pay
    Calculate the Federal withholding
    Calculate the State withholding
    Add Federal and State withholdings to find the total deduction
    Subtract total deduction from gross pay to find net pay
