1. Requirements Specification
    Get input from user for starting x and y coordinate and height/width of chessboard
    Display a chessboard with appropriate dimensions

2. System Analysis
    The width of one space will be 1/8 of the width of the chessboard
    The height of one space will be 1/8 of the height of the chessboard

3. System Design
    1) Import drawChessboard from chessboard
    2) Create main function
        Get input from user for starting location, chessboard height and width
        Call drawChessboard

            3) Define drawChessboard
                import turtle
                Draw a rectangle that has the width and the height the user inputed
                Call drawAllRectangles

                    4) Define drawAllRectangles
                        Use nested for loops to draw all rectangles (range(0, 4))
                        Call drawRectangle
                        Do two sets of for loops.
                            -The first set will draw every other row of rectangles
                            -The second set will draw the rest of the rows (by starting at the currentX += width/4

                            5) Define drawRectangle
                                Draw a rectangle by going to the startX, startY position and then drawing the inputed height and width with appropriate orientation of turtle

4. Testing

    Test 1-
            Input: X, Y coordinates: 20, 20
                   width: 200
                   height: 200
            Expected Output: Draws a chessboard starting at 20, 20 that has the dimensions of width = 200, height = 200
            Test Result: Passed

    Test 2-
            Input: X, Y coordinates: 0, 0
                   width: 100
                   height: 80
            Expected Output: Draws a chessboard starting at 0, 0 that has the dimensions of width = 100, height = 80
            Test Result: Passed
