2. System Analysis
    Distance = math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    Will need to use two if-else-if statements

3. System Design
    Displays "Welcome to the Social Situation Analyzer System"
    Displays "Person One"
    Get input from Person one
        -Name
        -Position(x, y)
        -Personal Space Radius
    Displays "Person Two"
    Get input from Person two
        -Name
        -Position(x, y)
        -Personal Space Radius
    Calculate the distance between the two points.
    Use an if-else-if statement to conduct person test
    Use an if-else-if statement to conduct space test

    Displays "Social Situation Analysis Results"
    Displays results of Person Test
    Displays results of Space Test

4. Testing
    Test 1-
        Input: p1 = (0, 0), 3
               p2 = (100, 100), 10
        Expected Output: Person Test: Neither p1 nor p2 is in the other's personal space
	                     Space Test: p1 and p2's spaces do not overlap
        Test Result: Passed

    Test 2-
        Input: p1 = (0, 0), 100
               p2 = (1, 5), 15
        Expected Output: Person Test: p1 and p2 are in each other's personal space
	                     Space Test: p2's personal space is entirely inside p1's personal space
        Test Result: Passed
